## Phenotypic Clustering

Phenotypic file upload, clustering settings and figures of the clustering results.

The phenotypic file must contain the following columns:

CTYDEL                               - Diagnostic delay (in years)

Country_of_Diagnosis                 - The country where the patient was diagnosed in ISO ALPHA-2 format

Sex_at_birth                         - Sex (1 = Male, 2 = Female)

Site_of_Onset                        - Site of onset (0 = Non-bulbar ,1 =  Bulbar)

Age_at_onset_years                   - Age at symptom onset (in years)

Time_to_death_or_last_followup_years - Disease duration until death or censoring (in years)

Phenotype_1                          - Clinical phenotype (0= Other, 1=ALS)

Phenotype_2                          - Clinical phenotype (0= Other, 1=PLS)

Phenotype_3                          - Clinical phenotype (0= Other, 1=PMA)

As diagnostic delay varies with the country of diagnosis, the webserver will standardize it. However, you can manually standardize diagnostic delay to have mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1 and select country of diagnosis as "Other" in the webserver.
